Group effort to solve the sparkfun HARP v2 puzzle

## First Session
1. Downloaded PDF files (in spec directory)
2. Connected device to computer and connected via terminal at 9600
3. Got the message "USB ID Fail"

4. Found a reference in one of the documents to adding a resistor to put the device in debug mode
3. Solder a 1k ohm resistor on the device.
